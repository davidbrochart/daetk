This is new code of DDASPK.f. The ADIFOR and MPI packages have been used in the 
new code. If you cannot access these packages or do not want to use them, just
link the code with the dummy routine:
   adf_dymmy.f    and    mpi_dummy.f
when you compile the DASPK code.

DSENSD.f is used for sensitivity analysis for the derived information.
